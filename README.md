# IPL Match Win Probability Model

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the win probability of IPL (Indian Premier League) cricket matches using a machine learning model. The model is trained on ball-by-ball data obtained from the Kaggle IPL dataset.
## Features
- Utilizes ball-by-ball data for feature extraction.
- Implements a machine learning model to predict match win probabilities.
## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle's IPL dataset. The ball-by-ball information provides a detailed view of each match, contributing to the model's accuracy.
